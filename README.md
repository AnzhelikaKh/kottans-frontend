Hi everyone! 
I want to start my career in Frontend and I wish success to all like-minded people :)

# General

<summary>First step.</summary>

## Git Basics

Well, the first step has been taken!
It was my first time using Git and it turned out pretty good.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Thanks to [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/), I consolidated my knowledge of Linux commands. I even learned how to use the command to throw a file for printing (including a specific printer), it was something new for me :)
Also, two articles on the work and structure of HTTP were a little boring, but useful)

## Git Collaboration
Well done!
It was interesting, I especially liked the site [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk), it was much easier to understand the material.

# Front-End Basics

<summary>Second step.</summary>


## Intro to HTML and CSS
Well, thanks to the [Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) course and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), I solidified my knowledge of HTML & CSS and learned a few new tricks that I didn't know before.I really liked the [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/) site - I got a little stuck on this site and achieved my **"gold"**.

In the end, I plan to use all the new knowledge gained while reviewing the course and passing Codecademy in the future :)

## Responsive Web Design
I love when the material is anchored in a game format (maybe I'm still a child inside). It's really much more interesting :)In principle, almost all the information from this section was new to me, but it seems that I still mastered most of it and understood the essence :)

Although I was not able to take the course for some time, I still return to it with new strength and inspiration.
