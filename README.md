Hi everyone! 
I want to start my career in Frontend and I wish success to all like-minded people :)

## Git Basics

Well, the first step has been taken!
It was my first time using Git and it turned out pretty good.
The task report (screenshots) are in the ["task_Git"](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKh/kottans-frontend/tree/main/Img/Img_Git) folder.


## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Thanks to [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/), I consolidated my knowledge of Linux commands. I even learned how to use the command to throw a file for printing (including a specific printer), it was something new for me :)
Also, two articles on the work and structure of HTTP were a little boring, but useful)
The task report (screenshots) are in the ["task_linux_cli"](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKh/kottans-frontend/tree/main/Img/task_linux_cli) folder.

## Git Collaboration
Well done!
It was interesting, I especially liked the site [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk), it was much easier to understand the material.
